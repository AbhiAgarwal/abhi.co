<h3><a href="http://abhiagarwal.com/ra-2015">ra - 2015</a></h3>
<p>
	In Fall 2014 I took a course called Compiler Construction, and it sparked my interest in trying to build my own language. The language I started building in my Spring 2015 semester is called Ra. The idea with Ra was to try build a language for web-application generation. Ra is built ontop of Go with C bindings.

<h3><a href="http://abhiagarwal.com/context-2014">context - 2014</a></h3>
<p>
	We set out to develop a reading experience that incorporates context of news articles. Given an article from a popular newspaper, what are possible stories and pictures that complement the article's content. We suggest a feed of content, including sentiment data on locations of events covered by the article and tweets from previous readers, to provide a more informed, and efficient reading experience. Context was built primarily in Python and won the <a href="http://challengepost.com/software/context-yu2ia">HackPrinceton Bloomberg Prize</a>.

<p>
	Creating a knowledge integration map for articles on Wikipedia, and using this to created a weighted graph and study associations between articles. Integrating this into a notes platform to help users understand how to connect their notes together and to guide them to things they should learn next. Learnt was built in Node.js.
