            <h2>brief history of Computer Science</h2>
            <p>
              I think it’s important to know the concepts that were formed over the centuries that later formed into the field of Computer Science, and the people who worked on those concepts. Most computer programmers know the history only from when C was created, but there were several key individuals who led to computers even existing. It was a process that started in the early 800s, and started to rapidly grow in the 1800s and the 1900s.
            </p>
            <p>
              You have to just wonder how simple changes in voltage can develop machines such as computers, and how the work of individuals across different centuries led to computers.
            </p>
            <h3>300 BC</h3>
            <p>
              In 300 BC <b>Euclid</b> writes a series of 13 books called Elements. The definitions, theorems, and proofs covered in the books became a model for formal reasoning. Elements was instrumental in the development of logic & modern science. It is known to be the first work in mathematics to solve a bigger problem by breaking it down into a series of numbered chunks.
            </p>
            <h3>300 BC-800s</h3>
            <p>
              Following Euclid, notes about recipes, rituals, cooking, etc. were the closest thing to how we think at algorithms today. In addition, there was also the inventions of mathematical methods — what we call <b>Gaussian elimination</b>, <b>the Sieve of Eratosthenes</b>, <b>Euclid’s algorithms</b>, and <b>methods for factorization and finding square roots</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              It seems common to us now to list things out in the order we will do them in, but in Mathematics at that time it was not a common idea. If you think about it algorithms are just a step-based representation on how to execute a theory. We've formalized it in the last couple hundred years and introduced ideas such as loops (i.e. repeat steps 1-3 until tomatos are boiled).
            </p>
            <h3>800s</h3>
            <p>
              The story really starts in the 800s where we meet a person named <b>al-Khwārizmī</b>, whose name roughly translates to Algoritmi, in Latin, and he develops a technique called Algorism, which is the technique of performing arithmetic with Hindu-Arabic numerals. He is considered, by some, to be the grandfather of Computer Science because — it is said that he was the first one to initially develop the concept of the algorithm in Mathematics.
            </p>
            <h3>1300s</h3>
            <p>
              Then came <b>Ramon Llull</b>, who is considered the pioneer of computation theory. He started working on a new system of logic in his work — Ars magna. He discusses a couple of theories, which influenced the development of a couple subfields within mathematics. For example, the idea of a formal language, the idea of a logical rule, the computation of combinations, the use of binary and ternary relations, the use of symbols for variables, the idea of substation for a variable, and the use of a machine for logic. All these led him to pioneer the idea of representing and manipulating knowledge using symbols, and logic.
            </p>
            <h3>1600s</h3>
            <p>
              Next came <a>Blaise Pascal</a>. He was a French Mathematician, and from an early age he was pioneering the field of calculating machines. He went on to inventing the mechanical calculator, and Pascal’s calculator after roughly 10 years, in 1642. This was an important milestone in Mathematics, and in engineering as it showed the general public that tools could be created to simplify things like accounting (fun fact: he built the first prototype for his father, an accountant).
            </p>
            <p>
              Following Llull’s work there was <b>Gottfried Leibniz</b>. He made an incredible achievements in symbolic logic, and made developments in First-order logic, which were important for the development of theoretical computer science. He worked on a bunch of advancements, one of which became Leibniz’s law (in First-order logic), and also Leibniz’s Rule (in Mathematics). Leibniz also discovered the modern binary system that we use today in his paper “Explication de l’Arithmétique Binaire”.
            </p>
            <h3>1800s</h3>
            <p>
              Known to be the father of computing <b>Charles Babbage</b> was credited for coming up and pioneering the concept of a programmable computer. He came up with the designs of the first mechanical computer, and the basic architecture of his machines were similar to a modern computer. He came up with the Analytical Engine, which was a general-purpose computer, and was a successor to his Difference engine. It was the first design that we, now, would call Turing complete. It incorporated an Arithmetic and Logic unit (ALU), integrated memory, and control flow statements. He designed it, but it wasn’t until 1940s that it was actually built. When he designed it was programmed by punch-cards, and the numeral system was decimal.
            </p>
            <p>
              Working with Charles Baggage on his Analytical Machine was <b>Ada Lovelace</b>. She is recognized to be the first computer programmer — in her notes on the engine she proposed the first algorithm that was meant to be ran on any machine (fun fact: it was an algorithm to compute Bernoulli numbers). Most of her work also contributed to the subfield of scientific computing, which was within the field of mathematics at that time (and also wasn’t exactly called “scientific computing”). (fun fact: about Ada lovelace: Her name inspired the programming language Ada — as you might know!)
            </p>
            <p>
              Then came a man most computer scientists should know about — <b>George Boole</b>. He was the pioneer of what we call Boolean Logic, which as we know is the basis of the modern digital computer. Boolean Logic is also the basis for digital logic and digital electronics, and most logic within electronics now stands on top of his work. (fun fact: The boolean datatype is named after him!) Boole also utilized the binary system in his work on algebraic system of logic, which inspired Claude Shannon to use the binary system in his work.
            </p>
            <p>
              A man named <b>Gottlob Frege</b> defined Frege’s propositional calculus (first-order logic), and predicate calculus, which was vital in the development of theoretical computer science. (fun fact: the Frege programming language is named after him)
            </p>
            <h3>1900s</h3>
            <p>
              In the early 1900s, <b>Bertrand Russell</b> invented type theory to avoid paradoxes in a variety of formal logics. He proposed this theory when he discovered that Gottlob Frege’s version of naive set theory was afflicted with Russell’s paradox. His proposed a solution that avoids Russell’s paradox by first creating a hierarchy of types, then assigning each mathematical entity to a type.
            </p>
            <p>
              After Russell came the amazing <b>Alonzo Church</b> who introduced Lambda calculus to the world. Lambda calculus introduced a new way of viewing problems in Mathematics, and inspired a large number of programming languages. Lambda calculus played a big part in the development of functional programming languages. (Why it is important, and here).
            </p>
            <p>
              Next, we all know the great <b>Alan Turing</b>. He formalized and establish a lot of concepts in theoretical Computer Science with his work on the Turing Machine, and also contributed heavily to Artificial Intelligence theory. Apart from that he was a codebreaker at Bletchley Park during WW2, and was deeply interested in mathematical biology theory. (His work and his papers are deeply insightful — you should give them a glance)
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Claude Shannon</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>John von Neumann</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>John Backus</b> was the inventor of the FORTRAN language with his team at IBM, and made many important contributions to functional programming languages and systems. He also served on committees developing the ALGOL system of programming languages, and developed a common notation, with Peter Naur, for describing and depicting programming languages called the Backus-Naur Form.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the same time as Backus, <b>Peter</b> Naur made major contributions in the definition ALGOL 60, and pioneered the Backus-Naur Form.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Noam Chomsky</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Dennis Ritchie</b> & <b>Ken Thompson</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Edsger Dijkstra</b>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Stephen Cook</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Leslie Lamport</b> laid out the foundations for the field of distributed systems. (fun fact: he won the Turing Award in 2013! He also lives in New York — so meet him if you have a chance.)
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Vint Cerf</b> & <b>Bob Kahn</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1989/1990, Tim Berners-Lee invented the worldwide web, and with his colleague <b>Robert Cailliau</b> sent the first HTTP communication between a server and a client. This as you all know was an important milestone in Computer Science as it represented a new era of communication, and also demonstrated the practical nature of theories in Computer Science.

              Let me know if I’ve gotten anything incorrect or haven’t made anything clear! Also I wasn’t able to include every individual along the way, but let me know if I’ve missed anyone very obvious. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I also didn’t go into much detail with every individual so I’m also going to be doing individual posts about each of these individuals in the next coming weeks. They will go in more details of their accomplishments, and I’m going to try and link their work together and show the progressions.
