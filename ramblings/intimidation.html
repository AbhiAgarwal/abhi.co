            <h2>being intimidated</h2>
            <p>
              <q>There's not a fixed amount of success and recognition in the world. So another person's accomplishments don't diminish the accomplishments available to you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
              Being intimidated of anyone is unnecessary. Why are worried about you being worse than anyone? You'll meet many people who are better than you, and a lot more people who are worse than you. You should never be scared off or intimidated by their skills. The fact is every single person you know, including yourself, can be successful. If your friend is much better than you doesn't mean that you both can't be successful. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Success is hard to measure - or to define. It's subjective. It still doesn't mean that you accomplishments can't be just as big or just as important. Learn from other people's accomplishments and appreciate them. Don't be negative and be fearful of them - the world is full of opportunities and ways to be successful.
