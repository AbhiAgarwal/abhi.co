            <h2>stay in college</h2>
            <p>
              tl;dr: Two years ago I passionately wanted to leave college. I'm glad I haven't. If what you're chasing is a high-pressure learning environment then don't leave. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I imagined leaving college to be very heroic. After leaving college you'd be able to learn things much faster, and actually do things you want. Actually sit down and work on tools and productions that actually change the world. But then I thought - life is long. I'm just 19. It's awesome to be excited and energetic, but I should give it a while and think about what I actually want from life before I quit. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Why do I want to leave so passionately? Why do I think I can learn things much faster outside college? It doesn't make sense. In college I have time to do things - I just choose to spend that time either procastinating or doing homework or going to classes. 
            </p>
            <p>
              You've to make sacrifices if you want to learn. But don't sacrafice college. The way I do most of my projects is that I spend a day a week finishing 2-3 weeks of material for each class. Then I'm able to skip the class for the next 2-3 weeks. There are shortcuts in which you're able to maximize both your college experience and your software-based learning.
