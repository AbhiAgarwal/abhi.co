            <h2>optimizations</h2>
            <p>
              There's a lot of optimizations that are done by the compiler at compile time. Here are a couple of them! Some compilers do these optimizations and some don't.
            </p>
            <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_reduction">strength reduction</a></h3>
            <p>
              Strength reduction optimizations usually take place in a loop. It usually looks for expression involving a loop invariant and an induction variable. Sometimes these operations can be simplified. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Strength reduction could be replacing X with Y in a piece of code. For example, replacing a multiplication with an addition. The point is to simplify a more complex expression (multiplication) with an addition expression.
            </p>
            <p>
              A <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_invariant">loop invariable</a></b> in compiler design are values that do not change within the scope of the loop.
            </p>
            <p>
              An <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induction_variable">induction variable</a></b> in compiler design is a variable that always gets increased or decreased by the same amount each time the loop iterates. When you have a particular loop for example <pre><code class="language-c">for (i = 0; i < N; i++)</code></pre> the variable i is always an induction variable. Induction variables can be said to be the values that are being iterated and changed every time the loop iterates. 
            </p>
            <p>The following example is taken from Wikipedia. Lets say we have a program with a constant c, an array y, and a bound N. We have setup a loop that has a the loop counter i and is bounded by N. Each time we are setting the index i of array y by the constant multiplied by i.</p>
            <p>
              <pre><code class="language-c">
c = 8;
for (i = 0; i < N; i++)
{
    y[i] = c * i;
}</code></pre>
            </p>
            <p>
              Here the loop invariant is c, and the induction variable is i. The loop invariable is c because it's a value set before the loop, and does not update in the scope of the loop. The induction variable is i because it's the variable that is being iterated or changed at every iteration of the loop. I believe it can also be said that y[i] is an induction variable because it's also being changed at each iteration of the loop, but we don't need to make this statement (as you will see).  
            </p>
            <p>
              When the strength is reduced for this particular block of code, it becomes: 
            </p>
            <p>
              <pre><code class="language-c">
c = 8;
k = 0;
for (i = 0; i < N; i++)
{
    y[i] = k;
    k = k + c;
}</code></pre>
            </p>
